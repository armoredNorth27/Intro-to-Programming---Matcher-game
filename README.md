# Matcher-game
A simple game where you're given a 4x4 board of symbols. You must try to match all the symbols. This was done as an assignment in a University course and I am uploading it with permission from the Professor, Farah Chanchary.

The rules of the game are all explained when you play it. There are also comments in the code with pretty much every function. This assignment was meant to bring together some simple concepts such as...
  
  -Functions <br>
  -Main function guard <br>
  -Getting user input <br>
  -Printing to the console <br>
  -Arrays(both 2D and 1D) <br>
  -Conditional statements <br>
  -Loops(for loops and while loops) <br>

These concepts are used in order to create a game with a bit of complexity behind it.
